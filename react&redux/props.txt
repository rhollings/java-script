 React: 'props'
 
 In React, you can pass props, or properties, to child components. 
 Say you have an App component which renders a child component called Welcome which is a stateless functional component.
 You can pass Welcome a user property by writing:

<App>
  <Welcome user='Mark' />
</App>

You use custom HTML attributes created by you and supported by React to be passed to the component.
In this case, the created property user is passed to the component Welcome. Since Welcome is a stateless functional component,
it has access to this value like so:

const Welcome = (props) => <h1>Hello, {props.user}!</h1>

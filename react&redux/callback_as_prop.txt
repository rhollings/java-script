You can pass state as props to child components, but you're not limited to passing data.
You can also pass handler functions or any method that's defined on a React component to a child component.
This is how you allow child components to interact with their parent components.
You pass methods to a child just like a regular prop. 
It's assigned a name and you have access to that method name under this.props in the child component.

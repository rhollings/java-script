There are two ways to create a React component. The first way is to use a JavaScript function. 
Defining a component in this way creates a stateless functional component. 
The concept of state in an application will be covered in later challenges. 
For now, think of a stateless component as one that can receive data and render it,
but does not manage or track changes to that data. (We'll cover the second way to create a React component in the next challenge.)

To create a component with a function, you simply write a JavaScript function that returns either JSX or null.
One important thing to note is that React requires your function name to begin with a capital letter.
Here's an example of a stateless functional component that assigns an HTML class in JSX:

const DemoComponent = function() {
  return (
    <div className='customClass' />
  );
};

const MyComponent = function() {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Text</p>
    </div>
  );
};

After being transpiled, the <div> will have a CSS class of customClass.

Because a JSX component represents HTML, you could put several components together to create a more complex HTML page.
This is one of the key advantages of the component architecture React provides. 
It allows you to compose your UI from many separate, isolated components. 
This makes it easier to build and maintain complex user interfaces

==================
The other way to define a React component is with the ES6 class syntax. In the following example, Kitten extends React.Component:

class Kitten extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Hi</h1>
    );
  }
}

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div><h1>Hello React!</h1></div>
    );
  }
};

This creates an ES6 class Kitten which extends the React.Component class. So the Kitten class now has access to many useful React features, 
such as local state and lifecycle hooks. Don't worry if you aren't familiar with these terms yet, they will be covered in greater detail in later challenges.
Also notice the Kitten class has a constructor defined within it that calls super(). 
It uses super() to call the constructor of the parent class, in this case React.Component. 
The constructor is a special method used during the initialization of objects that are created with the class keyword.
It is best practice to call a component's constructor with super, and pass props to both.
This makes sure the component is initialized properly. For now, know that it is standard for this code to be included.
Soon you will see other uses for the constructor as well as props.

===================== w/ Composition ============

Now we will look at how we can compose multiple React components together. Imagine you are building an app and have created three components: a Navbar, Dashboard, and Footer.

To compose these components together, you could create an App parent component which renders each of these three components as children. To render a component as a child in a React component, you include the component name written as a custom HTML tag in the JSX. For example, in the render method you could write:

return (
 <App>
  <Navbar />
  <Dashboard />
  <Footer />
 </App>
)

const ChildComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>I am the child</p>
    </div>
  );
};

class ParentComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>I am the parent</h1>
        { /* Component  */ }
        <ChildComponent />
        { /* Component  */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
};


When React encounters a custom HTML tag that references another component (a component name wrapped in < /> like in this example),
it renders the markup for that component in the location of the tag. This should illustrate the parent/child relationship between the App component and the Navbar,
Dashboard, and Footer.

const TypesOfFruit = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Fruits:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Apples</li>
        <li>Blueberries</li>
        <li>Strawberries</li>
        <li>Bananas</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

const Fruits = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      { /* Change code below this line */ }
      <TypesOfFruit />
      { /* Change code above this line */ }
    </div>
  );
};

class TypesOfFood extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Types of Food:</h1>
        { /* Change code below this line */ }
        <Fruits />
        { /* Change code above this line */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
};

The result should be a child component, nested within a parent component, which is nested within a parent component of its own!

class Fruits extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Fruits:</h2>
        { /* Change code below this line */ }
        <Citrus />
        <NonCitrus />
        { /* Change code above this line */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
};

class TypesOfFood extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
     super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Types of Food:</h1>
        { /* Change code below this line */ }
        <Fruits />
        { /* Change code above this line */ }
        <Vegetables />
      </div>
    );
  }
};

You create state in a React component by declaring a state property on the component class in its constructor.
This initializes the component with state when it is created. The state property must be set to a JavaScript object. 
Declaring it looks like this:

this.state = {

}

You have access to the state object throughout the life of your component. 
You can update it, render it in your UI, and pass it as props to child components. 
The state object can be as complex or as simple as you need it to be.
Note that you must create a class component by extending React.Component in order to create state like this.

class StatefulComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {name: "Frank"}
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{this.state.name}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};

/*
Code Explanation
We start off with a simple if statement to determine one of two outcomesâ€¦
If our string length is greater than the num we want to truncate it, 
we return a slice of our string starting at character 0, and ending at num. 
We then append our '...' to the end of the string.
However, if above situation is not true, it means our string length 
is less than our truncation num. Therefore, we can just return the string.
